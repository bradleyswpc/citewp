## Session 16 — Plugin admin v3 migration ✅

**Date:** 2026-05-01

**Deliverable:** Full plugin admin v3 migration shipped. `admin/css/citewp-aiso-admin.css` rewritten (~1,042 lines, 21 sections, all 18 P38 tokens active). `Menu.php` `render_dashboard_panel()` fully rebuilt to v3 composition per P39 Verdict 3: hero card with personalized greeting + 3 stat cards, 4-card KPI row, two-column lower section (AI Insights two-tone nested + Top Crawlers table / Needs Attention list + Quick Actions 4-wide grid), Pro Tip footer. P31 meta box consolidated into `EditorPanel.php` (replaces `ScoreMetaBox.php` + `SchemaMetaBox.php`). `IconLibrary.php` added (20 Lucide SVG icons). Settings + LogsPage light v3 styling. GEO Score → Cite Score rename throughout all PHP and CSS. `DashboardData.php` extended with `get_issue_count()` and `get_top_crawlers()` bot_type + prior_visits fields. X20 logged (component spec compliance audit before manual verification — derived from Session 16 multi-pass cleanup analysis). **P36 plugin code freeze lifted — v3 admin migration condition met.**

**Commits (plugin repo, Session 16):**
- `495f9b8` — chore: remove plus-jakarta-sans-800.woff2 (replaced by Inter v3)
- `6377390` — fix: swap bot avatar colors to P38 tint tokens; add solid tint token set to :root
- `a9c27b5` — feat: subagent C — Menu.php v3 rewrite, rail brand area, dashboard composition
- `b90094a` — feat: subagent E — EditorPanel P31 metabox, retire ScoreMetaBox + SchemaMetaBox
- `33e76b5` — feat: subagent F — swap Tailwind hex to P38 colors, rename GEO Score → Cite Score
- `6b8ba7e` — feat: subagent G — Settings + LogsPage light v3 (title rows, KPI cards, table wrap)
- `7402ea5` — fix: code-review blockers + warnings
- `402c638` — feat: Session 16 cleanup pass (KPI trends, hero stat cards, Needs Attention, AI Insights two-tone, rail descriptions, footer spacing)
- `095a2da` — feat: Session 16 tightening pass (brand area, KPI anatomy, hero chrome, AI Insights contrast, column swap + 45/55 ratio, 4-wide Quick Actions, Top Crawlers full table, Pro Tip orb)
- `38a054e` — feat: Session 16 closeout pass (wordmark color, Citrine brackets, Pro card copy, hero greeting, icon contrast, KPI score-band, AI Insights spacing, Quick Actions orb colors, Top Crawlers cap 3 + View Full Report, Pro Tip gradient, logo audit)

**Brain edits (Session 16 close, direct file edits — Brain folder has no accessible git shell):**
- `DECISIONS.md` — X20 logged: component spec compliance audit before manual browser verification. Derived from Session 16 multi-pass cleanup analysis — all deviations caught in three cleanup passes were enumerated in the UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md Component Library and required no judgment, just deterministic spec comparison.
- `UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` — wordmark spec amended (28-30px, "CiteWP" in `--citewp-text-on-navy`), plugin name spec (16px), Pro card copy updated to match shipped implementation.
- `00-CITEWP-MASTER.md` — Last updated, Session 16 appended to Shipped list, Current status updated (P36 freeze lifted, last commit `38a054e`), Next Session updated to Session 17 scope, Phase 1.5 sequence Session 16 marked ✅ shipped.

**Files modified (plugin):**
- `admin/css/citewp-aiso-admin.css` — full v3 rewrite
- `includes/Admin/Menu.php` — Dashboard panel renderer, rail brand area
- `includes/Admin/EditorPanel.php` — P31 consolidated meta box (new file)
- `includes/Admin/IconLibrary.php` — 20 Lucide SVG icons (new file)
- `includes/Admin/DashboardData.php` — `get_issue_count()` added, `get_top_crawlers()` extended
- `includes/Admin/ScoreMetaBox.php` — retired (logic absorbed into EditorPanel)
- `includes/Admin/SchemaMetaBox.php` — retired (logic absorbed into EditorPanel)
- `includes/Admin/Settings/Page.php` — light v3 styling
- `includes/Admin/LogsPage.php` — light v3 styling
- `includes/Plugin.php` — register EditorPanel, deregister old meta boxes

**Decisions made:**
- X20 — component spec compliance audit before manual browser verification (2026-05-01)

**Smoke test:** Manual browser verification passed across three review passes. Stats data flowing (108 visits this week, Top Crawlers rendered, KPI cards displayed, hero greeting personalized). No dedicated `/smoke-test` slash command found in `.claude/commands/` — slash command rebuild deferred per CLAUDE.md note (Session 7.5 carryover).

**npm build:** N/A — no JavaScript changes this session. CSS and PHP only.

**PHP lint:** Not run — PHP CLI not configured in LocalWP shell (per CLAUDE.md). No new PHP errors observed in debug.log during browser verification.

**WP.org status:** In review (submitted 2026-04-29). Awaiting approval email at hello@citewp.com. SVN commit held until approval confirmed per X16.

**Carryover into Session 17:**
- **WP.org SVN commit** — first task if approval email has arrived before Session 17 starts.
- **readme.txt + WP.org assets** — v0.7.0 changelog, screenshot updates, banner/icon review.
- **Anti-cloaking content** (S7) — landing page section + first blog post.
- **"Suggest a Feature" link** in admin — GitHub Discussions lean.
- **Page-builder canvas-mode awareness surface** — admin notice on Elementor/Divi/Bricks screens.
- **P33 (Posts/Pages stat split)** — Dashboard data layer. Still deferred.
- **Engine.php entities detector bug** — A11-gated. Still requires explicit user approval.
- **`citewp_aiso/metabox/tabs` filter `$context` arg** — Session 12 carryover, ships with EditorPanel follow-up if needed.

**Next session focus:** Session 17 — Phase 1.5 remaining: readme.txt + WP.org assets, anti-cloaking content (S7), "Suggest a Feature" link, page-builder canvas-mode awareness. Check WP.org approval status first — if approval email arrived, SVN commit is Task 1.

## Session 15 — v3 brand system reset, Citrine on Navy ✅

**Date:** 2026-04-30

**Deliverable:** Full v3 brand system shipped across Brain folder. P38 palette locked (18 tokens), P39 surface + layout verdicts, brand-kit-v3-citrine-on-navy.html canonical reference built, UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md fully rewritten under v3 with new Component Library section, X19 logged covering coherence audit + carry-over verdict discipline. **No plugin code shipped this session — P36 plugin code freeze remains in effect through Session 15.** Plugin admin migration to v3 is Session 16+ work via X13 pipeline.

**Brain edits (per X10 per-edit commit cadence):**
- `DECISIONS.md` — P38 logged (v3 palette: 18 tokens organized as 3 brand identity + 2 navy + 3 paper + 6 decorative tints + 4 score colors + 3 text + 1 border). Citrine `#E8D400` retained (user explicit: "I like poppy color"); reference CSS's softer `#F7D84A` rejected. Blue + Teal demoted to decorative tints only — re-skinned in reference: blue links/buttons → Citrine on navy / Obsidian on paper. P34 (Teal semantic citation/data role) and P35 (soft gray rail) explicitly superseded. SHA `16053c2`.
- `DECISIONS.md` — P39 logged covering three Step 2 verdicts: (Verdict 1) tagline placement amends P30 — moves from page header to rail, stacked under wordmark + plugin name lockup; (Verdict 2) surface-by-surface palette amends P26 with v3 specifics — admin pages full v3, WP Dashboard widget WP-native + score colors, post list column score colors only; (Verdict 3) Dashboard layout target amends P32 — hero card + 4-card stat row + 2-column lower section + Pro Tip footer composition. SHA `4a26bc7`.
- `DECISIONS.md` — X19 logged covering two paired rules: (1) coherence audit at session-start when amendment density crosses threshold (3+ amendments across 2+ consecutive sessions to same cluster); (2) carry-over verdict discipline when amending a P-row with dependents — each dependent gets explicit verdict, even when "principle survives." SHA `8a3cde9`.
- `Brain/brand/brand-kit-v3-citrine-on-navy.html` — 7-section brand kit demonstrating v3 design system: Hero / Architecture (three-name system) / Color (full P38 palette swatches) / Typography (Inter + JetBrains Mono on paper and navy) / Components (Dashboard composition: rail + hero card + 4-card stat row + AI Insights nested two-tone + Top Crawlers + Needs Attention + Quick Actions + Pro Tip footer) / Voice / Specs. Iterated through 4 review passes addressing user feedback (squared rail items, Lucide icons, two-tone AI Insights, score-band Cite Score color, KPI button styling). SHA `2f41530`.
- `Brain/design-reference/v3-reference-{dashboard,crawler-logs,cite-score}.png` — three ChatGPT-generated reference mockups committed (retroactive — Session 14 commit missed them). SHA `9535386`.
- `Brain/SESSION-15-BRIEF.md` — Step 5 stale line corrected (typography review marked RESOLVED by P37). SHA `800bda7`.
- `Brain/UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` — full v3 rewrite (~800 lines, replaces v2 system). Major sections: Design Philosophy (v3 SaaS register, deliberate inversion of v2), Color System (full P38 + Surface 1/2/3 application), Typography (P37 stack), Spacing (8px grid survives), Layout Patterns (rail spec from P28 + P39 V1, Dashboard composition from P39 V3), **Component Library (NEW)** — 12 components catalogued with structural specs (Wordmark, Rail brand area, Hero Card, KPI Card, KPI Button, AI Insights two-tone nested, Top Crawlers Table, Needs Attention List, Quick Actions, Pro Tip Footer, Score Badge, Score Gauge, Panel Link), What NOT to Do (rewritten — 12 new v3 rules + 3 surviving from v2), Cross-References. SHA `4050c47`.

**Decisions made:**
- P38 — v3 palette locked (Citrine retained, Navy adopted, Blue/Teal demoted to decorative tints)
- P39 — three Step 2 verdicts (tagline placement, surface palette, Dashboard layout) under v3
- X19 — coherence audit + carry-over verdict discipline (paired rules)

**Decisions superseded this session:**
- P34 — Teal semantic citation/data role (superseded by P38; Teal now decorative tint)
- P35 — Soft gray rail (superseded by P38; rail is now navy)
- P26 — surface-by-surface palette principle survives but specifics replaced (P39 V2 amends)
- P30 — tagline wording survives but placement moves rail (P39 V1 amends)
- P32 — three-column principle survives but layout target updated (P39 V3 amends)

**v2 vs v3 register difference:** v2 chased "look like the best WordPress plugin" (WP-native styling, no custom fonts, system color scheme). v3 deliberately inverts: "look like a modern SaaS product" (navy shell + Citrine accents + Inter typography + Lucide icons + decorative tint orbs). Buyer signal: mortgage industry + regulated industry buyers (S2) read WP-native as "free WordPress thing"; SaaS register reads as "professional software worth paying for." Plus: v3 register works across plugin admin + citewp.com website + Pro SaaS app — single visual language for three surfaces. v2 only worked on plugin and forced website + Pro to invent their own.

**Brand kit iteration history (Session 15, in-conversation):**
- Pass 1 (medium fidelity, ~630 lines) — structural skeleton with placeholder square icons. User feedback: rail brackets need to be squared not rounded, icons needed, cards should be same height, Cite Score 44 needs threshold color, AI Insights needs panel title.
- Pass 2 (~715 lines) — Lucide-style SVG icons, squared rail items + 3px Citrine left edge, paper-bg main column (not navy), trend percentages on KPI cards, hero stat icons added, AI Insights header strip with BETA badge, score-band-red on Cite Score 44, half-Citrine half-Blue button test.
- Pass 3 — all buttons unified to Blue text + paper-tinted background (Blue won the side-by-side); AI Insights wrapped in nested two-tone teal/purple-tinted card; hero card Cite Score back to white (red on navy looked bad); KPI cards restructured to icon-orb-left-of-title.
- Pass 4 (final, ~775 lines) — Improve buttons → Blue, panel-link → Blue, Top Crawlers reduced from 4 to 3 rows, KPI orbs reduced from 36×36 to 28×28 (icons 14px — ~25% larger than 13px title text), hero stat icons colorized purple/teal/orange.

**Final user assessment of v3:** "Serious upgrade." (Verbatim transcript not rendered here — full discussion in conversation history.)

**Plugin code status:** No plugin code shipped Session 15. P36 freeze remains active through end-of-session. Last plugin commits remain Session 14's three CSS commits (`6ae59cf` single-row header, `5633a69` soft gray rail, `d09b8a6` Teal tokens) — all stay in dev-branch history as artifact, will be superseded by Session 16 v3 migration before any user sees them. v0.6.0 stays in WP.org review hold pending coordinated launch with citewp.com website + Pro app.

**npm build:** N/A (no plugin code touched). **PHP lint:** N/A. **Browser verification:** brand kit visually verified by user in browser across 4 iteration passes.

**Carryover into Session 16:**
- **Plugin admin migration to v3 brand system** (X13 pipeline — multi-file CSS + PHP). Implements UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md v3 spec across `admin/css/citewp-aiso-admin.css`, `Menu.php` panel renderers, `PageHeader.php` (recreate — was deleted Session 13, needs to come back for the new rail + hero structure), Settings page, Logs page. All 18 P38 tokens active. Replaces Session 14's superseded CSS commits.
- **Inter + JetBrains Mono fonts:** add `inter-{400,500,700,800}.woff2` and `jetbrains-mono-{400,500,700}.woff2` to `admin/fonts/`. Add `@font-face` blocks at top of `citewp-aiso-admin.css`. Drop Plus Jakarta Sans and Fraunces font files (P37 dropped both).
- **WP Dashboard widget review** — verify it stays WP-native per P39 Verdict 2 (Surface 2). Score colors allowed for emphasis, no Citrine, no decorative tints, no Inter, WP system font stack only. Likely already correct from Session 12 implementation; needs verification.
- **Post list score column review** — verify minimal styling per P39 Verdict 2 (Surface 3). Score colors only. Already correct from prior sessions; needs verification.
- **P31 metabox consolidation styled to v3** — universal meta box position `'normal'` + tabbed structure from Session 13/14 carryover. Light v3 styling per UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md (sits between Surface 1 and WP-native).
- **Posts/Pages stat split** (number pre-allocated as P33, no DECISIONS.md row yet — log before Session 16 Dashboard build per SESSION-15-BRIEF.md guidance) — deferred from Session 13/14. Still relevant for Session 16 Dashboard data layer.
- **Engine.php entities detector bug** (A11-gated, dedicated session) — `ContentAnalysis.php` line ~165 `count_entities()` regex bug. Requires explicit user approval before any Engine.php touch.
- **DashboardData draft-exclusion comment** — `WHERE p.post_status = 'publish'` inline comment.
- **`citewp_aiso/metabox/tabs` filter `$context` arg** — Session 12 carryover, should ship with P31 build.
- **readme.txt + WP.org assets** — deferred until coordinated launch (website + Pro app + v0.7.0).

**Next session focus:** Session 16 — plugin admin v3 migration via X13 pipeline. Long session expected (multi-file refactor with PHP + CSS + JS coordination + browser verification + code-reviewer pass).

## Session 14 — Brain folder backup setup + brand system reset (X10 + P36 + P37) ✅

**Date:** 2026-04-30

**Retroactive entry:** This entry was not written at Session 14 close (end-of-session protocol gap caught at Session 15 start by Claude Code). Reconstructed from DECISIONS.md rows logged + git commit history + chat history. SHA references verified against actual git log.

**Deliverable:** Brain folder backed up to separate private GitHub repo (X10 executed); plugin admin styling experiments shipped (single-row header, soft gray rail, Teal tokens) then reset entirely when brand system was rebooted to Citrine on Navy. Three carry-over P-rows (P30, P31, P32) and one new X-row (X18) logged. Plugin code freeze imposed at session close pending Session 15 fleshout of v3 system.

**Brain repo creation (X10 executed):**
- New private GitHub repo `bradleyswpc/citewp-brain` created.
- Brain folder initialized with git, `.gitignore` configured (excludes `Brain-BACKUP/` same-disk redundant copy, OS junk, editor temp).
- Git identity configured (`bradleyswpc <131623150+bradleyswpc@users.noreply.github.com>` after initial placeholder identity discovered + corrected).
- Per-edit commit + push cadence operational from Session 14 forward.
- Brand assets relocated from `Desktop\CiteWP\brand\` → `Brain\brand\` to bring them under Brain repo cadence. `Brain\brand\` is canonical going forward.
- `brand-kit-v2-yellow.html` renamed to `brand-kit-v2-yellow-ARCHIVED.html` at session close per P36 closeout.

**Plugin code shipped (now superseded artifacts, will not reach users):**
- `6ae59cf` — single-row header layout per P30 work (lockup + tagline below in single column)
- `5633a69` — soft gray rail revert (replaced Session 13's experimental Obsidian rail) per P35
- `d09b8a6` — Session 14 CSS tokens (Teal semantic tokens per P34, soft gray rail tokens per P35)

**These plugin commits stay in dev-branch history but will be superseded by Session 16 v3 migration before any user sees them.** v0.6.0 stays in WP.org review hold; no SVN push to live until coordinated launch.

**Decisions made:**
- P30 — canonical brand tagline "SEO gets you ranked. CiteWP gets you cited." locked for all brand surfaces (placement amended later by P39 V1)
- P31 — universal meta box position `'normal'` + tabbed structure mirroring Yoast/Rank Math (P22 amendment)
- P32 — P27 amendment: column-count and card-grid pattern are distinct concerns; three-column permitted when columns hold distinct content types
- P34 — Signal Teal `#006D70` added as citation/data semantic accent (later superseded by P38 — Teal demoted to decorative tint)
- P35 — Admin rail soft gray `#F1EFE8` (Gray-50) with Obsidian text + 3px Citrine left-edge active (later superseded by P36/P38 — rail is now navy)
- P36 — **brand system reset to Citrine on Navy.** Mid-session, user surfaced ChatGPT-generated dashboard mockup as visual reference. Three motivations: (1) v2 Citrine + Obsidian palette accumulated complexity that read sterile; (2) pre-launch timing meant zero users would see the reset; (3) Citrine on Navy works across plugin + website + Pro app where v2 only worked on plugin. P21, P30, P34, P35 superseded as a set pending Session 15 fleshout. **Plugin code freeze imposed:** no further admin styling touches the plugin until Session 15 ships the new system.
- P37 — typography reset (Session 14 close addendum). Inter for UI + headings + wordmark; JetBrains Mono for numbers; Plus Jakarta Sans + Fraunces dropped entirely. Supersedes typography portion of P21.
- X18 — process decisions (X-rows) with deferred execution must be re-surfaced at every session-start protocol until executed, amended, or withdrawn. Soft deferrals must convert to hard task entries. Session-start grep `\[EXEC:` audit. Caught the X10 5-session gap (Brain backup deferred since Session 8) at Session 14 start.

**Brain edits Session 14 timeline:**
- Session start: X10 [EXEC: Phase 1.5] surfaced and executed — Brain repo bradleyswpc/citewp-brain created, per-edit cadence operational.
- Mid-session: P34 + P35 logged after Session 13 Obsidian rail experiment was reverted to soft gray + Teal added as semantic accent.
- Mid-session: brand kit v2-yellow visual review prompted reference mockup discussion → P36 brand system reset.
- Session close: P37 logged as addendum (typography settled before Session 15 starts).
- Session close: X18 logged from the deferred-execution drift pattern X10's gap exposed.
- Session close: SESSION-15-BRIEF.md written with rewrite scope.
- Session close: brand-kit-v2-yellow.html renamed to brand-kit-v2-yellow-ARCHIVED.html.
- Session close: UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md retained text + header note flagging pending Session 15 rewrite.

**npm build:** ✅ clean (CSS-only changes). **PHP lint:** ✅. **debug.log:** ✅ clean. **Browser verification:** Session 14 plugin commits visually verified before brand reset; reset rendered all of them artifact.

**Carryover into Session 15 (per SESSION-15-BRIEF.md, executed):**
- ✅ Step 1 — palette decisions (P38 logged Session 15)
- ✅ Step 2 — carry-over verdicts on P21/P30/P32/P34/P35/P26 (P39 logged Session 15)
- ✅ Step 3 — brand-kit-v3-citrine-on-navy.html build (committed Session 15)
- ✅ Step 4 — UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md major rewrite (committed Session 15)
- ✅ Step 5 — X19 logged (Session 15)
- ✅ Step 6 — SESSION-LOG.md retroactive Session 14 + Session 15 entries (this file, Session 15 close)
- Step 7 — handoff to Session 16 (Session 15 close, this entry)

**Next session focus (at Session 14 close):** Session 15 — full v3 brand system fleshout per SESSION-15-BRIEF.md. Plugin code freeze remains in effect through Session 15. (Session 15 executed all 7 brief steps; v3 system now ready for Session 16 plugin migration.)

---

## Session 13 close — Admin layout refactor + brand identity (P27 + P28 + P29) ✅

**Date:** 2026-04-29

**Deliverable:** Full admin layout refactor replacing the Session 12 hybrid (WP submenus + horizontal top tabs) with a single `add_menu_page`, Obsidian left rail, URL hash dispatch, and shared card surface. Visual polish pass brought the register in line with WP Rocket's reference. Brand identity locked: `[CiteWP]` wordmark with Citrine brackets, "AI Search Optimizer" plugin name inline, and canonical tagline "SEO gets you ranked. CiteWP gets you cited." in Fraunces 800 regular at 16px (Georgia fallback until `fraunces-800.woff2` loaded).

**Shipped / Modified:**
- `includes/Admin/Menu.php` — fully rewritten. Single `add_menu_page` (no `add_submenu_page`). `render_page()`: left rail loop, panel loop, inline JS with 5-priority `resolveSlug()` (hash → `citewp_section` param → `settings-updated` flag → sessionStorage → default), `hashchange` listener, click handlers with `history.pushState`. `citewp_aiso/admin/nav` filter extended with render-callback schema (X15 — FB28/FB30/FB34 register panels via this filter). `render_dashboard_panel()`: P27 single-column layout, SVG gauge, Needs Attention list, quick-action buttons. Header: `__brand` wrapper → `__lockup` (wordmark with Citrine `__bracket` spans + `__plugin-name`) + `__tagline` paragraph (canonical brand tagline). Null-guards on `module()` callables; `wp_nonce_url()` for regenerate button.
- `includes/Settings/Page.php` — stripped to pure panel renderer. Removed submenu registration, `.wrap` wrapper, `PageHeader` nav. Settings inner-tab state moved to `localStorage` (avoids hash conflict with outer `#settings`). Redirect uses `Menu::SLUG_PARENT` + `citewp_section=settings`.
- `includes/Admin/LogsPage.php` — stripped to pure panel renderer. `maybe_init_table()` now guards on `SLUG_PARENT`. List table form submits `page=citewp` + hidden `citewp_section=crawler-logs` field.
- `includes/Admin/PageHeader.php` — **deleted**. Wordmark inlined in `Menu::render_page()`.
- `admin/css/citewp-aiso-admin.css` — appended ~200 lines. Shared card surface (`.citewp-aiso-page` = outer card, `.citewp-aiso-rail` = 220px Obsidian strip, `.citewp-aiso-main` = padded white content area; Obsidian/white contrast replaces explicit right-border divider). Left rail BEM block: two-line items (`__item-label` uppercase + `__item-desc`), light gray text on Obsidian, white on hover/active, Citrine 3px left-edge accent + `rgba(232,212,0,0.08)` tint on active. Panel visibility (`display:none`/`display:block`). Stat-row Dashboard styles. Primary button brand override (`.toplevel_page_citewp .button-primary` → Obsidian fill, Citrine border on hover). Header card chrome: `__brand` column-flex wrapper, `__lockup` row, `__plugin-name`, `__tagline` (Fraunces/Georgia serif 800 normal 16px `--citewp-citrine-text`, `margin-top: 4px`), `__bracket` Citrine color. Responsive stack at ≤782px with `rgba` bottom divider. `--citewp-citrine-text: #8A7800` confirmed in `:root`.

**Commits:** `3863b1f` (Settings strip), `f2b9fe4` (LogsPage strip), `00d359a` (Menu rewrite), `8d6164d` (null-guard + admin_url hash fix), `5d47f52` (CSS Phase 2), `6104dce` (delete PageHeader + docs), `40f1937` (6-fix polish pass), `0352b9f` (wp_nonce_url fix), `78a7a1c` (rail descs + no flood-fill + Citrine brackets), `2914762` (header lockup container), `ff969db` (tagline → Plus Jakarta Sans), `ef59ab4` (canonical tagline below lockup), `9adcb7a` (shared card surface), `d18223d` (session log + P30), `8bd508f` (Obsidian rail + tagline Fraunces 800 normal 16px). Pushed to `origin/main`.

**Decisions made:**
- P30 logged: canonical brand tagline "SEO gets you ranked. CiteWP gets you cited." — locked wording for all brand surfaces. Fraunces 800 regular (italic dropped after visual review). `--citewp-citrine-text` color. P21 verbal-identity amendment.

**Post-session Brain updates:**
- `DECISIONS.md` — P30 added. Header datestamp updated.
- `UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` — left rail spec, shared card surface, lockup/tagline component rules should be updated in Session 14 to reflect final implementation (deferred — visual pass confirmed in browser first).

**Font carryover:** `fraunces-800.woff2` not yet in `admin/fonts/`. Tagline renders in Georgia/serif fallback. To activate Fraunces: drop `fraunces-800.woff2` into `admin/fonts/`, add `@font-face` (weight 800, normal) near top of `citewp-aiso-admin.css`. `plus-jakarta-sans-500.woff2` also not loaded — `__plugin-name` renders at weight 800 fallback until added.

**npm build:** ✅ clean (no JS changes). **PHP lint:** ✅. **debug.log:** ✅ clean. **Browser verification:** pending user confirmation — Obsidian rail is experimental; revert target is `9adcb7a` if it doesn't land.

**Carryover into Session 14:**
- **Posts vs Pages Dashboard stat split** (new, from Bradley's call): Replace single "Avg Cite Score" stat with two items — "Avg Post Score" + "Avg Page Score". Update `DashboardData` with optional `$post_type` param or separate methods. Empty state "—" when 0 scored posts/pages of that type. Log as **P32** in DECISIONS.md before build (P30 is the tagline decision, P31 is the meta box amendment, both logged this session).
- **Stat-row visual consistency** (new): 3-stat row (Posts avg + Pages avg + Bot visits) needs consistent chrome and vertical alignment. Current gauge vs bare-number treatment is inconsistent.
- **Engine.php entities detector bug** (new, A11-gated, NOT Session 14 scope — dedicated session needed): `ContentAnalysis.php` line ~165 `count_entities()` regex returns 0 on 20+ entity posts. Three regex flaws: (1) `{1,4}` min-2-word match excludes single-word entities (ChatGPT, Claude), (2) `[a-z]+` after capital excludes acronyms + CamelCase (AIOSEO, ChatGPT), (3) post-sentence-punctuation words excluded. Requires explicit user approval before any Engine.php touch.
- **DashboardData draft-exclusion comment** (minor): `WHERE p.post_status = 'publish'` is correct behaviour confirmed — add inline code comment explaining constraint; possible future tooltip "Includes published posts only".
- **Font loading**: `fraunces-800.woff2` + `plus-jakarta-sans-500.woff2` → `admin/fonts/`; add `@font-face` blocks.
- **UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md update**: Document final left rail layout, shared card surface, lockup/tagline component, Obsidian rail pattern, P30 tagline spec.
- `citewp_aiso/metabox/tabs` filter needs `$context` arg (`'score'`/`'schema'`) before Pro ships (carried from Session 12).
- **Session 14 primary**: readme.txt polish + WP.org asset prep (per P28 deferral). Likely longer session than originally scoped given additions above.

**Next session focus:** Session 14 — readme.txt + WP.org assets. Font loading. Dashboard stat split (P32). UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md update.

## Session 12 close — Admin UI polish pass (WP Rocket IA) ✅

**Date:** 2026-04-29

**Deliverable:** Full admin UI polish across all three CiteWP admin pages (Dashboard, Settings, Crawler Logs) and the WP Dashboard widget. WP Rocket-inspired IA with wordmark top nav, card-based sections, toggles, and X15 filter hooks on all four surfaces.

**Shipped / Modified:**
- `admin/css/citewp-aiso-admin.css` — new file (571 lines). Two `@font-face` rules (Plus Jakarta Sans 800, JetBrains Mono 400). `:root` design tokens (citrine `#E8D400`, obsidian, spacing/radius/shadow scale). All admin UI components: nav, cards, gauge, badges, stats banner, tabs, toggles, form sections, empty states. Toggle ON state uses `var(--wp-admin-theme-color)`, not citrine. BEM naming: `.citewp-aiso-nav` block.
- `admin/fonts/plus-jakarta-sans-800.woff2` — self-hosted font (12 KB, jsDelivr).
- `admin/fonts/jetbrains-mono-400.woff2` — self-hosted font (21 KB, jsDelivr).
- `includes/Admin/PageHeader.php` — new file. `render_nav(string $current_page)` static method. Four nav items. `apply_filters('citewp_aiso/admin/nav', $defaults)` (X15 hook #1).
- `includes/Admin/DashboardData.php` — new file. Service extracted from `DashboardWidget`. Four public methods: `get_average_score()`, `get_visit_trend()`, `get_top_crawled_pages()`, `get_lowest_scoring_posts()`. Shared by both `Menu.php` and `DashboardWidget.php`.
- `includes/Admin/Menu.php` — fully rebuilt. Added `enqueue_assets()` for CSS-only load on CiteWP screens. `render_dashboard()`: DashboardData queries, SVG semicircle gauge, 3-col card grid, `apply_filters('citewp_aiso/dashboard/cards', [])` (X15 hook #4), PageHeader nav.
- `includes/Settings/Page.php` — fully rebuilt. PageHeader nav, tabbed layout (general / crawler-detection / llms-txt), `apply_filters('citewp_aiso/settings/tabs', $default_tabs)` (X15 hook #2), toggle switches, card sections, inline JS tab switcher with URL hash persistence. Removed `inline_styles()` and its `admin_head` hook.
- `includes/Admin/LogsPage.php` — updated. PageHeader nav added. Stats banner migrated from inline styles to CSS classes. `inline_styles()` method deleted.
- `includes/Admin/DashboardWidget.php` — updated. Delegated four data methods to `DashboardData`. Added `apply_filters('citewp_aiso/dashboard/cards', [])` stub. Removed stale `Schema` import.
- `includes/Admin/ScoreMetaBox.php` — updated. Added `apply_filters('citewp_aiso/metabox/tabs', [])` stub (X15 hook #3).
- `includes/Admin/SchemaMetaBox.php` — updated. Same `apply_filters('citewp_aiso/metabox/tabs', [])` stub added.

**Commits:** `d0d736d`, `e212729`, `624811b`, `1d8eaf7`, `f72750d`, `8517e11`, `d6fa62b`, `06e2134`, `de44713`, `7771613`, `10a994e`, `9370db3`, `bc0e881`, `ad47bc4`. Pushed to `origin/main`.

**X15 extensibility hooks added:**
1. `citewp_aiso/admin/nav` — admin top nav items
2. `citewp_aiso/settings/tabs` — settings page tabs
3. `citewp_aiso/metabox/tabs` — score + schema meta box tabs
4. `citewp_aiso/dashboard/cards` — dashboard summary cards

**Decisions made (code session):** None new. Existing P19/P26/X15 drove all choices.

**Post-session Brain updates (Desktop, 2026-04-29):**
- P25 logged: plugin admin vs SaaS dashboard architectural separation (was phantom reference — resolved).
- P26 logged: P16 amended to polish-by-surface; UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md is the per-surface spec authority.
- P27 logged: single-column content areas for Phase 1.5 admin pages; card grid on Dashboard dropped.
- P28 logged: left rail nav inside the plugin page; WP submenus removed; Session 13 scoped as layout refactor.
- P29 logged: Session 13 implementation specifics — single `add_menu_page` (no submenus), URL hash dispatch (`admin.php?page=citewp#dashboard`), JS `hashchange` handler, all sections in DOM with `display:none` toggled client-side. Server-side separate slug dispatch (Rank Math pattern) explicitly rejected.
- X16 logged: end-of-session cross-reference + outcome accuracy verification rule.
- X17 logged: FEATURE-BACKLOG.md candidates use `FB` prefix (FB28–FB35); DECISIONS.md keeps `P/X/A/R/S` — distinct namespaces enforced permanently.
- UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md updated: surface-by-surface palette + left rail layout pattern. Spec current.
- Phase 1.5 sequence updated in master file: Session 13 = layout refactor, Session 14 = readme.txt + WP.org assets, Session 15+ = anti-cloaking.

**Note on cross-references:** Any entry above this that says "P28–P35 candidates" refers to what are now FB28–FB35. Per X17, preserved as-written historical artifacts — not retroactively edited.

**Forward design note (pre-Pro):** `citewp_aiso/metabox/tabs` fires from both `ScoreMetaBox` and `SchemaMetaBox` with the same key and no context argument. Before Pro ships, add a `$context` string argument (`'score'` / `'schema'`) so Pro can target each independently.

**npm build:** ✅ clean. **PHP lint:** ✅ all 8 new/modified files clean. **Browser verification:** ✅ all three admin pages, WP Dashboard widget, tab switching + hash URLs, toggles, CSV export, gauge rendering.

**Carryover into Session 13:**
- Layout refactor per P28 + P29: single `add_menu_page` (remove `add_submenu_page` for Logs + Settings), URL hash dispatch (`admin.php?page=citewp#dashboard` / `#settings` / `#crawler-logs`), JS `hashchange` handler, all section panels in DOM. `citewp_aiso/admin/nav` filter is the registration point for left rail items.
- Layout refactor per P27: drop 3-col Dashboard card grid; rebuild as single-column content area.
- UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md left rail spec is current — read it before writing the plan.
- `citewp_aiso/metabox/tabs` filter needs a `$context` arg before Pro ships.

**Next session focus:** Session 13 — Layout refactor per P27 + P28 + P29. Single `add_menu_page`, URL hash dispatch, JS hashchange handler, single-column content areas. Readme.txt + WP.org assets deferred to Session 14 per P28.

---

## Session 11 close (final) — Audit follow-up, FEATURE-BACKLOG.md, X15 ✅

**Date:** 2026-04-29

**Deliverable:** Log Rank Math audit findings as backlog candidates; add filter-extensibility rule (X15); wire backlog scan into `/session-start` protocol; add 6th Brain file. Pure documentation session — no code shipped.

**Shipped / Modified:**
- `Brain/FEATURE-BACKLOG.md` — new file. P28 (Cite Audit), P29 (Schema expansion), P30 (Cite Bridges), P31 (Role Manager), P32 (migration tools), P33 (email reports), P34 (Global Meta defaults), P35 (AI Citation Competitor Analyzer), Cite Tracker architecture reference, Rank Math pattern observations. Reference material only — not a roadmap.
- `Brain/00-CITEWP-MASTER.md` — rule 2 updated to "6 active files: master, decisions, scoring-rubric, competitors, ui-design-system, feature-backlog"; rule 7 added (backlog scan requirement per X15); Active Brain files table expanded to 6 rows; Horizon FEATURE-BACKLOG.md cross-reference added with X15 note; last-updated bumped.
- `Brain/DECISIONS.md` — X15 appended (filter-extensibility: settings tabs, meta box tabs, admin nav rail, dashboard widget cards all use `apply_filters` from first build); last-updated bumped.
- `.claude/commands/session-start.md` — Hard rules updated to "6 active files" list; Backlog Scan section appended (6-step protocol, surface taxonomy, format template, skip-is-a-violation enforcement). Committed `fad4f68`, pushed to `origin/main`.

**Decisions made:** X15 (filter-extensibility requirement for all UI surfaces hosting FEATURE-BACKLOG.md candidates).

**No code, no JS build, no debug.log errors.**

**Verified:** All file edits confirmed by read-back. Plugin commit pushed to GitHub (`fad4f68`). Brain files protected by robocopy backup.

**Carryover into Session 12:**
- Add P25 (plugin admin vs SaaS dashboard architectural separation) to DECISIONS.md Product table — text drafted in Session 11, deferred twice
- Manual browser verification: confirm meta boxes absent in Gutenberg, present in Classic/Elementor/Divi; TypeError resolved; Structure sub-score > 0 on post with H2/H3/list content

**Next session focus:** Session 12 — UI polish pass per `Brain\UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` (P19/X7). **Before writing the plan, run the backlog scan per X15**: Session 12 touches admin nav, settings tabs, dashboard widget cards, and meta box layout — P28, P30, P34 all overlap these surfaces and must be confirmed reserved (via filter hooks) or explicitly deferred.

---

## Session 11 close — Bookkeeping corrections ✅

**Date:** 2026-04-29

**Deliverable:** Correct Session 11 close bookkeeping. No code shipped.

**Changes made:**
- `Brain/DECISIONS.md` — P17 rewritten: plugin name locked as "CiteWP AI Search Optimizer – Optimize Content for AI Engines" in both `Plugin Name:` file header and readme.txt. The Session 11 amendment recommending shortening the file header was wrong and reverted. Added cross-reference to X14.
- `Brain/DECISIONS.md` — X14 added (Process table): AI agents must cite 3+ comparable products before recommending changes to user-facing naming, branding, or copy fields. "Shorter / cleaner" instinct is often wrong when a category convention exists (e.g. Yoast SEO's 60+ character display name in WP admin is the convention, not an exception).
- `memory/project_v070_checklist.md` — "Plugin Name: shortened to AI Search Optimizer" item removed. Note added: name stays as submitted per P17/X14.

**Decisions made:** X14 (agent naming/copy change discipline — cite 3+ comparables first).

**No code, no build, no debug.log check.**

**Verified:** DECISIONS.md edits confirmed by read-back. Checklist confirmed by read-back.

**Carryover into Session 12:**
- Add P25 (plugin admin vs SaaS dashboard architectural separation) to DECISIONS.md Product table — text drafted in Session 11, deferred to Session 12 close
- Manual browser verification: confirm meta boxes absent in Gutenberg, present in Classic/Elementor/Divi; TypeError resolved; Structure sub-score > 0 on post with H2/H3/list content

**Next session focus:** UI polish pass per `Brain\UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` (P19/X7).

---

## Session 11 — Universal Score + Schema Meta Boxes ✅

**Date:** 2026-04-29

**Deliverable:** Add native WP meta boxes for Cite Score and Schema Suggestions per P22, so both features are visible to non-Gutenberg users (Classic Editor, Elementor, Divi, Beaver Builder, Bricks). Brings ~95%+ editor coverage. Per P24 confirmed Session 11, meta boxes suppress when Gutenberg is active — sidebar and meta box surfaces are mutually exclusive per editor.

**Shipped:**
- `includes/Admin/ScoreMetaBox.php` — Cite Score display + recalculate button. Renders four states (scored / not yet scored / loading / error). Reads from post meta directly for display; calls existing REST recalculate endpoint via inline fetch.
- `includes/Admin/SchemaMetaBox.php` — Schema Suggestions with Article + FAQPage detection. Calls `Schema\Generator` directly in PHP (no REST round-trip). Clipboard-only copy action with advisory note (X12 compliant). Fade timer cleared on repeated clicks.
- `includes/Plugin.php` — wired both new modules into `boot()` under `is_admin()` block.
- Gutenberg-suppression logic — both meta boxes check `use_block_editor_for_post_type()` at registration; only appear when Gutenberg is NOT active.
- `src/sidebar/index.js` — `PluginDocumentSettingPanel` import moved from `@wordpress/edit-post` to `@wordpress/editor` per WP 6.6 deprecation. `npm run build` passes 0 warnings.

**Workflow validation:**
- Full Superpowers + code-reviewer pipeline used end-to-end for the first time (X13 logged as a result).
- Subagent dispatch: 2 parallel agents for ScoreMetaBox + SchemaMetaBox, sequential for Plugin.php wiring.
- 9 bugs caught across 2 code-reviewer rounds before commit.
- Manual browser verification caught 3 additional issues post-commit: duplicate Schema Suggestions panel in Gutenberg, PluginDocumentSettingPanel deprecation warning, unrelated TypeError on post-new.php.
- Performance verified: 82ms recalculate on no-throttle, ~2s on Slow 3G.

**Decisions made:** P24 (meta box / Gutenberg mutual exclusion), X13 (Superpowers + code-reviewer pipeline as required for multi-file feature work).

**Verified:**
- Cite Score meta box renders all four states correctly
- Recalculate succeeds, updates badge + sub-scores + timestamp in place, no page reload
- Schema Suggestions clipboard copy works, advisory note appears and fades
- "Already detected" badge logic correct (root-level @type collection, no sub-node noise)
- "No FAQ content detected" message appears for posts with < 2 Q&A pairs
- Capability checks aligned with REST permission_callback
- Hook priority 20 — no visual conflict with Yoast/Rank Math
- Build passes, no PHP errors in debug.log

**Carryover into Session 12:**
- Manual browser verification of Gutenberg-suppression fix (confirm meta boxes do NOT appear in Gutenberg, sidebar surfaces do; confirm meta boxes DO appear in Classic/Elementor/Divi)
- Manual verification of TypeError fix (confirm error gone after deprecation import update)
- Score test post with deliberate H2 + H3 + bulleted list structure, verify Structure sub-score > 0 (flagged in Session 11 as possible silent scoring bug — low priority, low cost to test)

**Next session focus:** UI polish pass per `Brain\UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` (P19/X7). Tabbed top nav across CiteWP admin pages, card-based settings layout, toggle switches over checkboxes, score gauge in dashboard widget, empty states with explanatory copy. Pending UI strategy sessions before code begins.

---

## Session 10 — Schema Generator (Phase 1.5) ✅

**Date:** 2026-04-28

**Deliverable:** Build the JSON-LD schema generator (P14) — auto-suggest Article and FAQPage schema markup from post content, surfaced as a "Schema Suggestions" panel in the Gutenberg Document Settings sidebar.

**Shipped:**
- `includes/Schema/Generator.php` — new `CiteWP\Aiso\Schema\Generator` service:
  - `generate_article_schema(WP_Post)`: complete Article JSON-LD (headline, dates, description, author, featured image, publisher with site icon → custom logo fallback, mainEntityOfPage)
  - `generate_faq_schema(WP_Post)`: FAQPage JSON-LD when ≥ 2 question/answer pairs found; H2/H3 detection by question-word prefix OR trailing `?`; first `<p>` before next heading as answer; returns `[]` if < 2 pairs
  - `detect_existing_types(WP_Post)`: top-level `@type` values from JSON-LD blocks in post_content only (not recursive — prevents nested sub-nodes like Person/Organization/WebPage from appearing as independent detected types)
  - Internal `ContentAnalysis` caching: one `apply_filters('the_content')` call per request
- `includes/Rest/SchemaController.php` — `GET /citewp/aiso/v1/schema/{post_id}` → `{article, faqpage|null, detected[]}`, permission `current_user_can('edit_post')`
- `src/sidebar/index.js` — `SchemaSuggestions` component via `PluginDocumentSettingPanel` (`@wordpress/edit-post`) in Document Settings sidebar (always visible; separate from the Cite Score `PluginSidebar`):
  - Article + FAQPage rows: Insert button, "Already detected" badge, "✓ Added" badge
  - FAQPage empty state: "No FAQ content detected (need ≥ 2 Q&A pairs)"
  - Other detected types: read-only "X schema detected — more types coming soon"
  - Re-fetches after post save (mirrors ScoreSidebar `wasSaving` pattern)
  - Block inserted via `insertBlock(block)` with no index (safe append, avoids root-count-only error with nested blocks)

**Modified:**
- `includes/Plugin.php` — wired `Rest\SchemaController` into `boot()` outside `is_admin()` block
- `build/index.js` + `build/index.asset.php` — recompiled; new dependencies: `wp-blocks`, `wp-edit-post`

**Bugs caught and fixed during code review:**
- FAQ `<p>` extraction now scoped to content before next heading (prevents block-injected markup capturing wrong answer)
- `insertBlock(block)` without index (was `insertBlock(block, getBlockCount())` — root-count broken for nested blocks)
- `setInserted({})` moved before try block in `fetchSchema` (prevents stale badge on failed re-fetch)
- `detect_existing_types()` changed from recursive to root-level-only collection (fixes Person/Organization/WebPage noise)

**Decisions made:** P20 (DECISIONS.md) — schema generator implementation choices.

**Verified:**
- "Schema Suggestions" panel appears in Document Settings sidebar
- Article Insert → Custom HTML block at end of post with valid Article JSON-LD
- "Already detected" badge shown after autosave + re-fetch
- "No FAQ content detected" shown for posts with no FAQ structure
- Person/Organization/WebPage sub-type noise removed
- REST endpoint returns 403 (not 404) without auth — route registered, permission_callback active
- No debug.log PHP errors
- `npm run build` 0 warnings

**Carryover into Session 11:** None — Session 10 deliverable complete.

**Next session focus:** Phase 1.5 — UI polish pass per `UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` (P19/X7): tabbed top nav, card-based settings layout, toggle switches, score gauge in dashboard widget, empty states. User has strategy sessions on UI design pending before this session begins.

---

## Session 9 — WP.org Submission ✅

**Date:** 2026-04-28

**Deliverable:** Complete and submit the WP.org plugin package for `ai-search-optimizer` v0.6.0.

**Shipped:**
- `assets/` folder — all WP.org submission assets committed:
  - `icon.svg` (copied from Desktop/CiteWP/logos/, `[A]` mark, Citrine bg, SMIL animated)
  - `icon-128x128.png` + `icon-256x256.png` (from logo-export-kit.html, fixed `[C]`→`[A]` bug in `drawIcon()`)
  - `banner-772x250.png` + `banner-1544x500.png` (designed in Canva: `[AISO]` wordmark, tagline, 3 feature callouts, Citrine divider)
  - `screenshot-1.png` through `screenshot-5.png` (Gutenberg sidebar, post list column, dashboard widget, crawler logs, settings)
- `readme.txt` — `== Screenshots ==` section added (5 descriptions matching screenshot order)
- `.distignore` — `assets/` added to exclusion list
- `.gitattributes` — `export-ignore` rules for all dev-only files; `git archive` now produces a clean distribution zip
- `.gitignore` — `build/` removed from ignored files; compiled JS now tracked so distribution zip includes the Gutenberg sidebar
- `src/sidebar/index.js` — two fixes:
  - `chartLine` → `chartBar` (chartLine removed from @wordpress/icons; build now compiles with 0 warnings)
  - Recalculate hint text moved below button (was clipping in narrow sidebar at `justifyContent: space-between`)
- `logos/logo-export-kit.html` — fixed `[C]`→`[A]` in `drawIcon()` (icon PNGs now match plugin identity, not parent brand)
- `ai-search-optimizer-v0.6.0.zip` — built via `git archive --format=zip`, submitted to WP.org plugin directory

**Commits (4):**
- `feat: WP.org submission assets, screenshots, sidebar icon + hint text fix (v0.6.0)`
- `chore: add .gitattributes export-ignore rules for WP.org SVN package`
- `chore: track build/ in git for WP.org distribution`
- pushed to `origin/main` (`0431cfa..40c7e1f`)

**Decisions made:** None new.

**WP.org outcome:** Submitted 2026-04-29 (corrected 2026-04-29 — earlier "approved/live" entry was incorrect; the WP.org submission confirmation page was misread as approval). Slug assigned: `ai-search-optimizer`. Awaiting review email from `plugins@wordpress.org` to hello@citewp.com. Typical queue 2-14 days. Plugin NOT yet committed to WP.org SVN — that step happens only after approval email arrives.

**Carryover into Session 10:** None — Session 9 deliverable complete.

**Next session focus:** Phase 1.5 — UI polish pass per `UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` (P19/X7): tabbed top nav across CiteWP admin pages, card-based settings layout, toggle switches, score gauge in dashboard widget, empty states. OR Schema generator (P14) — user to choose priority at session start.

---

## Session 8 — Brand Kit & WP.org Asset Prep (Side Mission) ✅

**Date:** 2026-04-28

**Deliverable:** Nail down brand architecture before creating WP.org submission assets. Resulted in complete brand kit, logo export toolkit, and animated SVG plugin icon. Main WP.org submission track carries into Session 9.

**Shipped:**
- `brand-kit-v2-yellow.html` — Obsidian & Citrine brand kit (active, canonical)
- `logos/logo-export-kit.html` — browser-based export tool; downloads all WP.org PNGs (icon-128, icon-256, banner-772, banner-1544) + standalone wordmarks via Canvas API
- `logos/icon.svg` — animated plugin icon; SMIL background pulse (#E8D400 → #F5EC30) + CSS scale breathe; runs as `<img>` on WP.org without JavaScript
- `logos/color-comparison.html` — ecosystem color analysis page (reference, not a deliverable)
- `Desktop/CiteWP/.agents/product-marketing-context.md` — full 12-section product marketing context document

**Archived (not deleted):**
- `brand-kit-v1-ink-ivy-ARCHIVED.html` — Ink & Ivy palette (green + gold)
- `brand-kit-v2-ember-ARCHIVED.html` — Obsidian & Ember (orange — kept for future use)
- `brand-kit-v2-teal-ARCHIVED.html` — Obsidian & Verdigris (teal — archived reference for future per-product color)

**Decisions made:**
- S8 (DECISIONS.md): Single Citrine accent across CiteWP parent and all current products. Per-product color differentiation deferred until a second product ships. Rationale: multi-neon-on-black reads as 80s synthwave, not expert AI SEO authority.
- Logo convention confirmed: `[Name]` full wordmark / `[X]` icon. Plus Jakarta Sans 800. Bracket positioning (text in lower-center of bracket span) is typographically correct — not a mistake.
- WP.org SVG icon strategy confirmed: `icon.svg` takes precedence over PNGs when placed in `assets/`. SMIL animations run even as `<img>`.
- Ecosystem color exploration concluded: Citrine (53°) + Teal (168°) + Magenta (318°) triangle rejected — 80s aesthetic. Option A chosen: one color, ship the product.

**Memory updated:** `project_brand_kit.md` — palette tokens, logo rules, ecosystem color policy, logo export kit path.

**Carryover into Session 9:** Main Session 8 track — WP.org submission assets still need to be downloaded from export kit and packaged. readme.txt `== Screenshots ==` section not yet written. SVN package not yet built. Submission not yet made.

**Next session focus:** Resume WP.org submission — download assets from logo-export-kit.html, write screenshots section in readme.txt, smoke test, build SVN package, submit.

---

## Session 7.5b — `.claude/` Infrastructure Rebuild ✅

**Date:** 2026-04-27

**Deliverable:** Rebuild the `.claude/` directory lost in the Session 7.5 git corruption. Resolves the last open carryover thread from Session 7.5. Parallel to Session 8 — does not touch plugin code.

**Shipped (2 commits on `main`):**
- `0fd0759` chore: rebuild .claude/ infrastructure (hooks, commands, settings)
- `d51a569` docs: update CLAUDE.md and SESSION-LOG.md to current Brain file names + add UI Design Rules section

**Files added (committed under `.claude/`):**
- `settings.json` — registers four hooks (PreToolUse, PostToolUse x2, Stop)
- `hooks/block-engine-edit.sh` — blocks edits to `includes/Scoring/Engine.php` unless `.claude/.engine-edit-approved` sentinel exists. Master file rule #4 / DECISIONS.md A11 enforced.
- `hooks/php-syntax-check.sh` — runs `php -l` on edited `.php` files. Non-blocking. Searches LocalWP-bundled PHP path if `php` isn't on PATH.
- `hooks/js-build-reminder.sh` — prints reminder to run `npm run build` when `src/**/*.js` or `*.jsx` is touched.
- `hooks/stop-checklist.sh` — prints end-of-session checklist with most-skipped steps highlighted (SESSION-LOG, DECISIONS, master file, push).
- `commands/session-start.md` — `/session-start` slash command.
- `commands/session-end.md` — `/session-end` slash command.
- `commands/smoke-test.md` — `/smoke-test` slash command (10-step Session 7.5 smoke test, X6-compliant).
- `README.md` — documents polarity, hooks, commands, gitignore pattern.

**Files updated (commit 2):**
- `CLAUDE.md` (plugin) — replaced dead Brain references (`11-SESSION-PROTOCOL.md` → master file section; `08-DECISION-LOG.md` → `DECISIONS.md`; `12-SCORING-RUBRIC.md` → `SCORING-RUBRIC.md`). Added UI Design Rules section pointing at `Brain/UI-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` per X7.
- `SESSION-LOG.md` (this file) — same dead-name cleanup.

**`.gitignore` patched:** `.claude/*` ignored by default with explicit un-ignores for `hooks/`, `commands/`, `settings.json`, `README.md`. `settings.local.json` and `.engine-edit-approved` remain gitignored (machine-local state).

**Default state set:** `.engine-edit-approved` deleted post-rebuild, so Engine.php is locked by default. Sentinel must be manually created (`New-Item -ItemType File -Path .claude/.engine-edit-approved`) before any approved edit, deleted after.

**Decisions made:** X8 (`.claude/` content split: hooks + commands + project `settings.json` committed; machine-local state gitignored).

**Process lesson — chat→clipboard→editor autolink mangling:**

When pasting code blocks containing filenames like `name.md` or `name.sh` from Claude.ai chat into a Markdown-aware editor (or via certain clipboards), the bare filename gets converted to a Markdown autolink: `[name.sh](http://name.sh)`. This affected both filenames-on-disk and file contents during the rebuild attempt.

The chat renderer also displays clean text as autolinked when shown back in the chat window, which created confusion during diagnosis — eyes-on-terminal screenshots were the only reliable ground truth.

**Resolution:** Built the rebuild as a downloadable zip (`citewp-claude-rebuild.zip`) generated from a sandbox where no autolink processing exists, then extracted into the plugin folder. Verified with a `verify.ps1` script that asserted (a) all 9 expected files present, (b) no filename contains brackets/URLs, (c) no file CONTENT contains the bracketed-URL pattern. All 19 checks PASS before commit.

**Going-forward rule for AI-assisted file creation in this project:** if the file content references other filenames with extensions (`.md`, `.sh`, `.json`, etc.), do not paste from chat through any Markdown-aware editor. Use one of: (a) downloadable zip, (b) Filesystem MCP, (c) PowerShell `Set-Content` with literal here-strings typed (not pasted) directly into the terminal.

**Verified:**
- `git status` clean post-cleanup.
- Hook executable bits set on first commit (mode `100755` for all four `.sh` files in commit `0fd0759`) — fresh clones inherit correctness.
- Hooks not yet end-to-end tested in a live Claude Code session (will verify next time Session 8 work resumes from the plugin folder).

**Carryover into next session:** None. The Session 7.5 carryover thread is closed.

**Next session focus:** Resume Session 8 — WP.org submission prep (image assets, screenshots section in readme.txt, final smoke test, SVN package, submit).

---

## Session 7.5 — Multi-Product Architecture Refactor ✅

**Date:** 2026-04-27

**Deliverable:** Refactor codebase to multi-product architecture per A14. Plugin folder, slug, namespace, and ~110 identifiers renamed to align with WP.org distribution strategy (CiteWP parent brand + AI Search Optimizer plugin slug).

**Final identifier contract (per A14):**
- WP.org slug: `ai-search-optimizer`
- Display name: "AI Search Optimizer – Optimize Content for AI Engines"
- Author: CiteWP
- PHP namespace: `CiteWP\Aiso\` (CiteWP\ stays as company-level root for future plugins)
- DB tables: `wp_citewp_aiso_*`
- Options/transients/cron/post meta: `citewp_aiso_*` / `_citewp_aiso_*`
- REST namespace: `citewp/aiso/v1`
- Constants: `CITEWP_AISO_*`
- Text domain: `ai-search-optimizer`
- Script handles: `citewp-aiso-*`
- CSS classes: `citewp-aiso-*`

**Shipped (10 commits on `refactor/multi-product-architecture` branch):**
- `c1394bc` Step 2: rename main file, update header/constants/autoloader/hooks
- `d1dab98` Step 3: namespace + @package across 22 PHP files (CiteWP\Aiso sub-namespacing); Engine.php math untouched
- `d26a08c` Step 4: option keys, table names, post meta, transients, cron hooks, constants → citewp_aiso_*
- `47a2c16` Step 5: REST namespace citewp/v1 → citewp/aiso/v1
- `2a8aabe` Step 6: text domain 'citewp' → 'ai-search-optimizer' (63 i18n calls across 7 files)
- `dbcd238` Step 7: JS sidebar slug citewp-geo-score → citewp-aiso-geo-score, header comment
- `315feca` Step 8: script handle + CSS class prefix citewp- → citewp-aiso- (~100 occurrences across DashboardWidget, LogsPage, PostListColumn, EditorAssets, Settings/Page, Menu)
- `9bc7651` + `01dcf94` Step 9: readme.txt replaced entirely with draft v0.6.0 (initial commit was a partial merge; fixed in follow-up)
- `c1eca79` Step 11: CLAUDE.md updated to reflect AISO architecture
- `cd21381` Step 12 fix: removed Domain Path header (no languages folder yet), shortened readme short description to <150 chars (Plugin Check fixes)

**Smoke test (10/10 passed):**
1. Plugin activates with new display name — PASS
2. DB table `wp_citewp_aiso_crawler_logs` created on activation — PASS
3. Three options created with `citewp_aiso_*` prefix — PASS
4. Gutenberg sidebar loads, score displays, recalculate works — PASS
5. `/llms.txt` and `/llms-full.txt` serve correctly — PASS
6. `curl -A "GPTBot/1.0"` logs to new table with correct vendor mapping — PASS
7. Dashboard widget renders with score data, bot counts, top crawled pages — PASS
8. Crawler Logs admin page renders, filters work, CSV export works — PASS
9. REST endpoint `/wp-json/citewp/aiso/v1/score/{id}` returns expected response (`citewp_aiso_forbidden` from address bar without nonce — confirms route registration AND error code rename) — PASS
10. uninstall.php cleans all data — PASS (highest-risk step; verified zero `citewp%` options, zero `_citewp%` post meta, zero `wp_citewp%` tables after delete)

**Plugin Check final state:** Same baseline as Session 7. All remaining warnings are local infrastructure files (`.claude/`, `.gitignore`, `CLAUDE.md`, `SESSION-LOG.md`) excluded from WP.org SVN package via `.distignore`. Zero real errors in shipped code.

**Decisions made:** A14 (multi-product architecture, CiteWP\ as company root with per-plugin sub-namespaces); P17 amended (slug `ai-search-optimizer`, display name keyword-stuffed, internal architecture refactored, Cite Score remains as feature name).

**Catastrophic loss + recovery (documented for posterity):**

During the FIRST attempt at this refactor, the local `.git/` directory got corrupted at Step 1 — only `.git/objects/` survived, all other git metadata (HEAD, refs, config, index) and the entire working tree were destroyed. Cause not definitively identified but strong correlation with: (a) folder rename happening while Claude Code's terminal CWD was inside the renamed folder, (b) Windows Defender real-time scanning of `node_modules/`, (c) possible LocalWP file watcher activity. Steps 2-11 of the first attempt were never committed (original brief specified single-commit-at-Step-14) and were lost entirely.

A SECOND corruption occurred during Step 13's smoke test: WordPress's plugin Delete action partially succeeded (uninstall.php ran cleanly, all DB cleanup verified) but the physical file deletion failed mid-operation due to a file lock on a deeply-nested `node_modules/` file. Same `.git/` corruption signature (only `objects/` remained).

**Recovery:** Both incidents were recoverable because: (1) every step of the SECOND attempt was committed and pushed to `origin/refactor/multi-product-architecture` immediately (per-step commit cadence introduced as a process change), and (2) a robocopy backup excluding `node_modules/`, `build/`, and `.git/` was made to `Desktop/ai-search-optimizer-BACKUP/` before the uninstall test.

**Process changes adopted:**
1. **Per-step commits AND pushes** instead of single-commit-at-end. Cost: slightly messier history that can be squashed later via `git rebase -i`. Benefit: catastrophic loss = minutes lost, not hours.
2. **Manual folder renames** via Windows Explorer with Claude Code session fully closed first. Never rename a folder while a tool has the folder as its CWD.
3. **Defensive 4-grep policy** after every step: bare prefix (`citewp[_-]`), REST/path (`citewp/`), namespace (`(namespace|use)\s+CiteWP\\(?!Aiso)`), and `@package CiteWP$` patterns. Caught 100+ identifiers across multiple categories that the brief did not enumerate.
4. **LocalWP plugins folder added to Windows Defender exclusion list** to reduce file-lock interference during dev work.
5. **Never test WordPress plugin Delete against the live source folder.** WP core's `delete_plugins()` calls `WP_Filesystem::delete($plugin_dir, true)` — a recursive delete on the entire plugin folder. Combined with Windows file locks on deeply-nested `node_modules/` files, this reliably corrupts `.git/`. For uninstall.php verification, use one of: (a) `git archive --format=zip --output=../test.zip HEAD` then upload the zip via WP Admin (clean install separate from source), (b) move the live folder out of plugins/ temporarily before testing, or (c) maintain a second LocalWP site for destructive testing only.

**Known carryover into Session 8:**
- WP.org submission image assets not yet created: icon-128x128.png, icon-256x256.png, banner-772x250.png, banner-1544x500.png, screenshot-1.png through screenshot-N.png. CiteWP company logo (blue/purple chat-bubble) becomes the WP.org plugin icon; banner uses CiteWP branding with "AI Search Optimizer" wordmark.
- `readme.txt` is missing a `== Screenshots ==` section. Add when actual screenshots exist.
- `.claude/` infrastructure rebuild deferred (was lost in corruption, was always gitignored, never on GitHub). Not blocking. Schedule as standalone session before Session 8 if needed.
- The `ai-search-optimizer-WP-DELETION-BROKEN/` and `ai-search-optimizer-BROKEN-DO-NOT-USE/` folders sit in the plugins directory as recovery artifacts. Delete after a clean Windows reboot when file locks are released.
- `Brain/14-REFACTOR-BRIEF-SESSION-7-5.md` should be archived (refactor complete) or kept as a reference for the architecture pattern.

**Next session focus:** Session 8 — create WP.org submission image assets (icon, banner, screenshots), add Screenshots section to readme.txt, final pre-submission smoke test, submit to WP.org plugin directory.

## Session 7 — WP.org Plugin Check + Submission Prep ✅

**Date:** 2026-04-26

**Deliverable:** Run WP.org Plugin Check, fix all errors/warnings, rename plugin to comply with WP.org trademark rules, bump to v0.5.0.

**Shipped:**
- `citewp.php` — Plugin Name header renamed to "Cite Score — AI Search Optimization"; version bumped to 0.5.0
- `readme.txt` — display name, FAQ, installation section updated to "Cite Score"; Tested up to bumped to 6.9; Stable tag 0.5.0; 0.5.0 changelog entry added
- `.distignore` — new file; excludes `.claude/`, `CLAUDE.md`, `SESSION-LOG.md`, `src/`, `package*.json`, `node_modules/` from WP.org SVN package
- `includes/Admin/LogsPage.php` — CSV export replaced `fwrite`/`fclose` with direct `echo` streaming; `esc_sql()` on `$table`; phpcs annotations for nonce false-positives and custom-table queries
- `includes/Admin/LogsTable.php` — `esc_sql()` on `$table`; unified phpcs:disable block for all custom-table query annotations; phpcs:ignore on 4 GET filter params
- `includes/Admin/DashboardWidget.php` — `esc_sql()` on `$table`; moved DirectQuery phpcs:ignore to query lines
- `includes/Crawler/Detector.php` — `sanitize_text_field()` on `HTTP_USER_AGENT`; phpcs:ignore on IP/URI/referer (sanitized by `filter_var`/`esc_url_raw`); `esc_sql()` on prune `$table`
- `includes/Settings/Page.php` — phpcs:ignore on read-only GET display flags
- `includes/Llms/Generator.php` — phpcs:ignore on `apply_filters('the_content')` core filter call
- `includes/Scoring/ContentAnalysis.php` — same as above
- `uninstall.php` — phpcs:ignore on global vars, SchemaChange, slow meta_key

**Decisions made:** P8 amended — WP.org display name changed to "Cite Score — AI Search Optimization", WP.org slug to be requested as `cite-score`. Internal code (namespace, DB tables, REST routes, option keys, folder name, GitHub, domain) unchanged (see DECISION-LOG.md).

**Verified:**
- `npm run build` succeeded (3 pre-existing chartLine warnings only — not introduced this session).
- Plugin Check re-run pending (user to verify after LocalWP cache clears).
- Note: `.claude/` directory errors will still appear in LOCAL Plugin Check runs — this is expected. `.distignore` excludes them from the actual WP.org SVN submission package.
- Committed `48bd190` and pushed.

**Carryover into Session 8:**
- WP.org submission image assets not yet created: `icon-128x128.png`, `icon-256x256.png`, `banner-772x250.png`, `banner-1544x500.png`, `screenshot-1.png` through `screenshot-N.png`. These require design work.
- `readme.txt` is missing a `== Screenshots ==` section with descriptions — needs to be added before submission.
- After assets are ready: add Screenshots section to readme.txt, do final smoke test, submit to WP.org.

**Next session focus:** Session 8 — add Screenshots section to readme.txt, final smoke test (all features working), WP.org submission.

## Session 6 — Security Audit + Plugin Check Prep ✅

**Date:** 2026-04-26

**Deliverable:** Pre-WP.org submission security pass, hygiene cleanup, and version bump to 0.4.0.

**Modified:**
- `LICENSE` — added GPL v2 license file (WP.org submission requirement)
- `citewp.php` — version bumped to 0.4.0
- `readme.txt` — version bumped to 0.4.0; description rewritten to reflect actually-shipped features (crawler logs, llms.txt, GEO Score, dashboard widget, filters, CSV); 0.4.0 changelog entry added
- `uninstall.php` — added missing `citewp_llms_settings` option to cleanup; added all `_citewp_*` post meta cleanup; added transient cleanup
- `includes/Llms/Router.php` — removed `nocache_headers()` call that contradicted the explicit `Cache-Control` header set immediately after
- `includes/Admin/LogsPage.php` — added `phpcs:ignore` annotations on direct DB stat queries (Plugin Check expects either a justification or a wpdb wrapper; annotations chosen since stats need raw aggregation)
- `includes/Admin/LogsTable.php` — same `phpcs:ignore` treatment on count/filter queries
- `includes/Admin/DashboardWidget.php` — removed redundant `meta_query EXISTS` (the `meta_key` filter already enforces existence; was a double-check that confused Plugin Check)
- `includes/Admin/Menu.php` — removed stale placeholder comment

**Decisions made:** None new. Standard pre-submission hygiene against existing Plugin Check expectations.

**Verified:**
- LICENSE file present and correct (GPL v2 — required for WP.org).
- Uninstall genuinely removes everything: crawler_logs table, both options, all post meta, transients.
- llms.txt cache headers no longer contradict each other.
- Direct DB queries justified inline; Plugin Check annotations in place.
- Committed and pushed: `f5e5699` — `feat: security audit + Plugin Check prep (v0.4.0)`.

**Carryover into Session 7:**
- None. Plugin should now pass WP.org Plugin Check tool. Next session is to actually run the tool and address anything it flags.

**Next session focus:** Session 7 — run WP.org Plugin Check, fix any remaining warnings, prepare WP.org submission assets (banner, icon, screenshots).

---

## Session 5 — Settings Polish + Crawler Stats + CSV Export ✅

**Date:** 2026-04-26

**Deliverable:** Summary stats banner (24h/7d/30d), bot type filter, date range filter, and CSV export on the Crawler Logs page. Settings page inline-style cleanup.

**Modified:**
- `includes/Admin/LogsTable.php` — added `extra_tablenav()` with bot + date-range filter dropdowns; updated `prepare_items()` to apply both filters to COUNT and data queries; added `validated_bot_filter()`, `validated_range_filter()`, `range_to_since()` helpers
- `includes/Admin/LogsPage.php` — replaced thin description text with 3-stat banner (24h/7d/30d); added "Export CSV" button; added `handle_csv_export()` (nonce + capability checked, streams UTF-8 BOM CSV with current filters applied); added `inline_styles()` scoped to logs screen
- `includes/Settings/Page.php` — moved `style="display:block"` inline style to `.citewp-cpt-label` CSS class via `inline_styles()` / `admin_head` hook

**Decisions made:** None new.

**Verified:**
- Stats banner renders correctly on Crawler Logs page.
- Bot type and date range filters narrow the table and persist in pagination.
- Export CSV downloads a valid file with headers and local timestamps; Chrome download prompt is expected browser behavior on localhost, not a plugin issue.
- `npm run build` succeeded (3 pre-existing warnings only).
- Committed and pushed: `28e91e8`.

**Carryover into Session 6:**
- None.

**Next session focus:** Session 6 — Plugin Check + security audit.

---

## Session 4 — Dashboard Widget ✅

**Date:** 2026-04-26

**Deliverable:** WordPress Dashboard home widget showing avg GEO score, bot visit trend, top crawled pages, and lowest-scoring posts.

**Shipped:**
- `includes/Admin/DashboardWidget.php` — registers on `wp_dashboard_setup`; displays 4 sections: avg GEO score stat (grade-colored), bot visits last 7d vs prior 7d with trend arrow, top 5 crawled URIs (last 7 days), lowest 5 scored posts with edit links

**Modified:**
- `includes/Plugin.php` — wired `DashboardWidget` into `is_admin()` block

**Decisions made:** None new. All decisions consistent with prior sessions.

**Verified:**
- Widget appears on WP Dashboard home (wp-admin/index.php).
- Avg GEO score, bot visit trend, crawled pages, and lowest-scoring posts all render correctly.
- `npm run build` succeeded (3 pre-existing warnings from sidebar `chartLine` icon — not introduced this session).
- Committed and pushed: `12b993e`.

**Carryover into Session 5:**
- None.

**Next session focus:** Session 5 — Settings page polish + crawler dashboard summary stats + CSV export.

---

## Session 3 — GEO Score (Engine + REST + Sidebar + Post Column) ✅

**Modified:**
- `citewp.php` — version bumped to 0.3.0
- `includes/Plugin.php` — wired Scoring + Rest + PostListColumn + EditorAssets into `boot()`
- `readme.txt` — 0.3.0 changelog entry
- `.gitignore` — added `build/` and `node_modules/`

**Decisions made (logged in `Brain/08-DECISION-LOG.md`):**
- A11: Scoring engine in PHP, not JS (single source of truth, REST-served to React)
- A12: On-save scoring, not real-time per keystroke
- P9: 100-point system, 3 categories (Structure 35 / Citability 40 / Authority 25), 17 signals
- P10: Both Gutenberg sidebar AND post list column
- P12: Default sidebar discoverability via kebab menu (no auto-pin)
- S6: Public scoring rubric as differentiator
- X1: Two CLAUDE.md files (strategy + code)
- X2: SESSION-LOG.md inside plugin folder

**New canonical doc:** `Brain/12-SCORING-RUBRIC.md` — full rubric specification.

**Verified:**
- "Hello world!" default post scored 16/100 red — math behaving correctly.
- Sidebar registers in editor (kebab menu → Panels → CiteWP GEO Score; star to pin).
- Category expansion shows per-signal pass/partial/fail with messages and recommendations.
- Recalculate button refreshes score.
- Save → auto-recalculates.
- Post list shows colored sortable score column.
- `npm run build` succeeded after installing `@wordpress/icons`.
- 23 PHP files lint clean.

**Carryover into Session 4:**
- None.

**Next session focus:** Session 4 — Dashboard widget (avg GEO score, top crawled pages, bot visit trend, link to logs).

## Session 2 — llms.txt Auto-Generator ✅

**Date:** 2026-04-26

**Deliverable:** `/llms.txt` and `/llms-full.txt` served dynamically by WordPress with content selection logic.

**Shipped:**
- `includes/Llms/ContentSelector.php` — tiered selection (Pages → cornerstone → recent quality posts → opted-in CPTs)
- `includes/Llms/Generator.php` — builds llms.txt content per llmstxt.org spec
- `includes/Llms/Cache.php` — 1-hour transient with smart invalidation hooks
- `includes/Llms/Router.php` — registers rewrite rules and serves dynamic content
- `includes/Settings/Page.php` — admin UI for llms.txt configuration

**Modified:**
- `citewp.php` — version bumped to 0.2.0
- `includes/Plugin.php` — wired Llms + Settings modules into `boot()`
- `readme.txt` — 0.2.0 changelog entry

**Decisions made (logged in `Brain/08-DECISION-LOG.md`):**
- A10: llms.txt via rewrite rule, not physical file in webroot
- P11: Tiered content selection with smart defaults

**Verified:**
- `http://citewp-dev.local/llms.txt` serves valid output.
- `http://citewp-dev.local/llms-full.txt` serves expanded content version.
- SEO plugin integration confirmed (Yoast/Rank Math/AIOSEO meta detection).
